Smart soil selector app is an android app to detecting pH, temperature, and NPK sensors on IoT-based soil and combined with a microcontroller as the control center. This android app is for analyzing soil or soil before planting. 

The goal is to make it easier to choose suitable plants based on soil quality so that it is easy for farmers to optimize their land to get maximum results.


I built the backend of this application with google firebase, some of the firebase features were used are :
 - Firebase hosting for stores plants images 
 - Firebase Authentication for the login feature
 - And for the database, using firebase cloud store & real-time database
  
I also created a User Interface design for this android app using Figma, you can preview the result at this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/szzhmN07u0lgAgxacy5BVv/Smart-Soil-Selector?node-id=0:1)
