**Ayatnesia** is an Android application that I developed as part of my Thesis Project to complete my studies at UNU Blitar, Department of Computer Science. This innovative app is designed to facilitate research into finding the Indonesian translation of Al-Qur'an verses that are most relevant to the user's keywords. I used Flutter for the front-end and Python with FastAPI for the back-end to create this powerful tool.

The data used in Ayatnesia is sourced from the official website of the Ministry of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia, [quran.kemenag.go.id](https://quran.kemenag.go.id/).

### ðŸ’Ž Key Features

Ayatnesia offers a range of key features to enhance your Quranic research experience:

- **Comprehensive Surahs:** Access all the Quran Surahs effortlessly.
- **Detailed Surah Information:** Get in-depth insights into a specific Quran Surah.
- **Lexical Verse Search:** Search for verses using lexical measures.
- **Semantic Verse Search:** Find verses using semantic measures.
- **Lexical Semantic Verse Search:** Conduct searches with both lexical and semantic measures.

### ðŸš€ Explore Ayatnesia Backend

The backend of Ayatnesia has been meticulously built with Python and FastAPI, ensuring top-notch performance and reliability. You can explore the backend code and functionalities on [GitHub](https://github.com/utrodus/fastapi-ayatnesia).

Ayatnesia is not just an app; it's a bridge that connects language and faith, making Quranic research more accessible and meaningful.
